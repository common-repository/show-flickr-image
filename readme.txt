Let visitors in China can see the Flickr Images you put in your post. The plugin replace the flickr image's default url to the available url which can be access in Mainland China.

== Description ==

The dafault urls which flickr image is using are something like:

"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/xxx/xxx.jpg"

"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/xxx/xxx.jpg"

"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/xxx/xxx.jpg"

and etc.

But now in Mainland China, some of these urls is unreachable, because of "GFW".

So if you are using flickr images in your blog post, not all of them can show out when a reader in China visit it.

This plugin just replace the flickr image's url in your post, from its default hostname to flickr east server's hostname, which is reachable in Mainland China.
